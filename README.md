Watchface for Pebble Time. This is based on the design of [TimeDrol](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5581620e8ec60e2319000014) from **X.adA**

## Things I have added

1. The circle fills with the minutes instead of being static.
2. Added vibration when bluetooth connection is lost (optional).
3. Added a configuration page.
  1. Show / Hide the day and date.
  2. Customize all the colors.
  3. Toggle vibration on connection loss.

## Things I may add or change later (also see [issues](https://github.com/Robinhuett/Circumflexus/issues))

* Use a lighter font (Segoe UI?)
* Adding support for Classic Pebble.
* Display of weather instead of the day.
* Optional show batery level instead of analog minutes.
